# Collatz Conjecture

What is the Collatz Conjecture?
 The Collatz Conjecture states that if you take any positive number and perform the following operations on it:
 
    * If the number is even, divide it by two.
    
    * If the number is odd, triple it and add one.
    
That process will eventually reach the number 1, regardless of which positive number was chosen initially

This Python program let's the user enter in an integer and watch the program run the Collatz algorithm on that number and charts it for the user. If the user wants to run it again, they close the chart and are given the option to run the program again or not.
